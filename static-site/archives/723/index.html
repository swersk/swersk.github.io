    <h1>Babeloo Designs</h1>
    <div>&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, I launched a Babeloo Designs. Inspired my experiences on the Camino de Santiago and living in Italy, I designed and developed a product line of 28 SKUs from concept to production, infusing them with elements that represent global cultures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bolster our market presence, I partnered with a top-rated NYC shop, taking the brand into the B2B wholesale arena. Overseeing product development and sourcing, I collaborated directly with Italian and Chinese suppliers. My role involved handling a range of logistical and operational challenges, including quality control, international freight, and inventory management. This consistent effort led to an acknowledgment on Etsy where I was named the Star Seller for three consecutive months, and one of our products achieved bestseller status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;</div>
