    <h1>It&#39;s all over by the time you&#39;re 5</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll never forget when my economics professor claimed that, &#34;It&#39;s all over by the time you&#39;re age 5.&#34; While he was referring to return on investments of early childhood education, the comment can also apply to childhood obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new study released this week, a child who enters kindergarten overweight has a 32% chance of becoming obese, 4 times the chance of normal-weight children. By the time a child enters kindergarten, much of the risk factors are already in place. In other words, if you make it to kindergarten without being heavy, your chances of being a normal weight for life are significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is a reminder of how important the first 5 years of life are. We must address obesity from a developmental standpoint and prevention efforts must begin much earlier than we originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:Â http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309753?query=featured_home&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>
