    <h1>Sugar: An intro</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;Sugar seems to be all over the news these days. From NPR* to ABC News**, who claimed that bananas were officially deemed too high in sugar for monkeys- yes, monkeys -it seems like you can&#39;t read about nutrition without reading about sugar. What&#39;s the deal- is it just a transient hype? Another substance to target in our quest to lose weight? Or is this for realz?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My food passion and exploratory journey into nutrition actually began about 7 months after moving to Spain, in April 2011, when I realized that I no longer craved sugar. Ever. &#34;That&#39;s happening to me too! And it happened to my sister here!&#34; my Canadian friend told me, and I was immediately curious- what&#39;s driving this, or is it completely coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until almost 2 years later when I read David Gillespie&#39;s &#34;Sweet Poison&#34; book on sugar that I realized there was a science behind it all: the less sugar you have, the less sugar you crave. Of course, it&#39;s more complicated than that (stay tuned!) Having been in an environment with less sugar additives, I simply stopped craving it- and lost some pounds along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started, take this quiz to see if you&#39;re addicted to sugar. It&#39;s a little silly...but I&#39;d say important questions to ask yourself are: Do you think about sugar or dessert even if you&#39;re not hungry? Do you &#39;crash&#39; at 3pm every day and look for something sweet to eat or drink to help? Are you unable to celebrate a birthday or event without eating something sweet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those extra curious readers out there, a simple guide to sugars:Â http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/14/sugar-guide-forms-sweet-calories-sweetener&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/01/15/262741403/why-sugar-makes-us-feel-so-good)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-15/zoo-stops-giving-bananas-to-monkeys-for-27health-reasons27/5201310&lt;/p&gt;</div>
