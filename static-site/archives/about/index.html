<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Hi, I’m Lauren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="About">I started my career as a public school teacher in NYC with Teach for America because I wanted to change the trajectory of kid’s lives. It turns out I ended up changing the trajectory of my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since then, I’ve been involved in the tech and education sector spanning the Ministry of Education of Spain, digital education strategy at Coursera, instructional design at Facebook and product management at Waking Up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While at Harvard pursuing a Master's degree, I was influenced by Seymour Papert's "MindStorms," which teaches us that coding is not only a tool to build, but a way to train our minds to think differently. It empowered me to learn coding, and I have since become a full-stack engineer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm hard-working, curiosity-driven, and thrive in collaborative, positive team environments. I'm especially interested in education, climate, data visualization, entrepreneurship, and mission-driven organizations. </p>
