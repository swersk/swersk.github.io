    <h1>Why you Should Eat in Season</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;Quick question: When is the best time to buy broccoli? July or December? Yeah, I didn&#39;t know either. Why does it matter though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving dinner was coming to a close, and a huge fruit platter sat on the buffet table for dessert. As everyone grabbed their fruit of choice, my boyfriend whispered in my ear, &#34;Watermelon? In November?&#34; Of course, being from Italy, he only eats watermelon in July and August- when they&#39;re in season. I hadn&#39;t even thought twice about eating watermelon in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re so used to any kind of food we want, whenever we want it, often overlooking the value of eating foods in in season. To clarify, when a food is in season, it means &lt;em&gt;that&#39;s when it&#39;s naturally grown from the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. An orange doesn&#39;t grow in summer, so we shouldn&#39;t eat it then, for example. Watermelon grows in summer, so we should eat it then and only then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons why you should eat in season:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;. The relative abundance of the crop usually lowers the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Taste&lt;/strong&gt;. Ever had a tomato that was mealy and granular? Gross. It probably wasn&#39;t in season, shipped in from afar, or grown in unnatural conditions. When a food is not in season locally, it is grown in a hothouse or shipped from other parts of the world, both affecting the taste. When a food is transported from another part of the world, they have to be harvested early and refrigerated during the trip so they don&#39;t rot, and therefore don&#39;t ripen as well as in their natural environment. They don&#39;t develop their full flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;. A food that has endured the shipping process loses nutrients along the way. Buying something in season and locally ensures it has all its nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice: &lt;/strong&gt;Have no fear, there&#39;s always something in season!
