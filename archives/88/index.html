    <h1>Wooo!</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;What a cool turn of events!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I read the book &#34;Sweet Poison: Why Sugar is Making Us Fat&#34; by David Gillespie, a lawyer turned researcher and activist based in New Zealand. It totally changed the way I look at food and sugar and I highly recommend you read it! It was literally life changing; the moment I finished the book, I knew my eating habits were forever changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also check out the powerpoint I made summarizing what I learned, which I later presented to the bf. (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WXVEQiitDH8hEMqfSH16Uv-KHXgbiK3QSvSL1mdn7DE/edit?usp=sharing) . I now follow David&#39;s blog &#34;Sweet Poison&#34; on Facebook where I get lots of good information about nutrition  (also recommended reading).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently started a new Facebook page dedicated exclusively to education. I was inspired by our shared interests and e-mailed him. I thanked him for the work he does and told him it&#39;s &#34;nice to see someone else has the same interests; funny how they can intersect!&#34; He just wrote back- he said thanks and wants to see the powerpoint I made! Cool!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&#39;t it amazing how interconnected the world is? Never ceases to amaze me!&lt;/p&gt;</div>
