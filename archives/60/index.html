    <h1>Why the Paleo Diet is BS</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/01/michael-pollan-paleo-diet-inquiring-minds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I read about food, the more I am convinced that diets don&#39;t work. I am suspicious of any diet, trend, or anything that tells you to restrict a certain food group. The Southbeach diet, the no-carb diet, and now the Paleo Diet are all unsustainable, restrictive ways to go about eating. I encourage you to read this article; Michael Pollan has a way of explaining complex ideas simply. If you don&#39;t feel like reading it though, here&#39;s a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Justifying daily consumption of meat  by saying our hunter-gatherer ancestors did the same is wrong; our ancestors rarely ate meat, and they didn&#39;t have certain enzymes that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-We shouldn&#39;t completely avoid bread. Bread has nutrients from grains. Whole wheat and whole grain bread are rich in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Fermented foods are good for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-A 100% raw food diet is not 100% healthy. Cooking can actually bring out nutrients in food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Cook! A cooked meal is almost always healthier than eating out.&lt;/p&gt;</div>
