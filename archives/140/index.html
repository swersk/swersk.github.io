Not only is it perfect on a cold day, but it&#39;s yummy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel obliged to discuss my &#34;inspirational conversations,&#34; in the hope that you&#39;ll be inspired too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I was out to dinner with two Chinese friends who both ordered hot water before the meal. I thought it was a bit strange but intriguing. They told me all about the tea and hot-water-with-lemon culture in China; their culture believes in its ability to improve health by preventing sickness, increasing energy, and improving your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) My neuroscience/education professor told our class that it&#39;s never too late to learn a new language. In fact, he said, it&#39;s never too late to learn anything. You might not learn it as quickly, but with persistence and practice you&#39;ll pick it up. While drinking hot water with lemon isn&#39;t technically a new skill, I like to think of it in the framework as &#34;I&#39;m not too old to acquire a new habit.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon further research I learned that drinking water with lemon before meals is a great weight-loss tool because the citric acid contained in the lemon helps to activate digestive enzymes and hormones associated with satiation triggers. It activates chemical signals to your brain that says &#34;enough is enough&#34; while eating - the complete opposite of processed and refined foods like white bread/rice, snacks, fast foods, etc. that trick your brain into thinking you&#39;re hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re afraid of the high acidity contained in lemons, just a small piece will do! Also, it&#39;s more effective if done on an empty stomach, like early in the morning or before a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of new habits, I&#39;m going to do some work over a hot cup of water with lemon and wait for the magic to happen! Did I mention it is also directly correlated with good grades? (I wish!)&lt;/p&gt;</div>
