    <h1>Overcoming Feelings of Powerlessness with Food</h1>
    <div>&lt;p&gt;I received bad news a few days ago: a friend&#39;s mom was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly, out of nowhere. Ugh. With news like that, you can&#39;t help but feel completely helpless. Why her? What can we do now? How can we prevent this? Why is there no cure? and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the silver lining is this: as much as things may seem out of our hands, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in our control is what we put in our bodies. To some extent, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; control the fate of our health by not putting chemicals and toxic substances in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News like this, news we&#39;ve probably all had at one point, only reaffirms how important it is to adopt and maintain healthy habits: cooking food ourselves, and reading ingredient labels and avoiding anything with additives or chemicals. Being serious about not putting &lt;em&gt;toxic carcinogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&#39;s not easy to uncover what&#39;s in our food- cooking can be time consuming, and reading ingredient labels can be arduous- but if it means doing whatever we can to both feel good (and look good, if that motivates you) in the present and avoid unwanted health problems in the future, it&#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear news like cancer, counting calories seems futile. Who cares about calories in moments like these? If I could give one message to everyone it would be: forget counting calories, but look at the &lt;em&gt;ingredients&lt;/em&gt; and eat only REAL food. It is one of the few things we can actually control in a life full of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petition* to remove azodicarbonamide, a toxic chemical illegal in Europe and Australia, from our foods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://action.ewg.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=2070&amp;amp;tag=201403ADAActionActionCenter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Petitions work: that&#39;s why Subway committed to removing azodicarbonamide from their subs!&lt;/p&gt;</div>
